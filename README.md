# Tiva_C_UART
This project implements a UART-based LED control system for the TM4C123GH6PM microcontroller. The program enables communication between the microcontroller and a PC via UART0, allowing users to control the onboard LEDs (red, green, and blue) through PuTTY or similar serial terminal software.
